# Running the examples
Generally:

```
ansible-playbook  -i inventory.txt   <playbook yml>
```
# Specifying the ip / login / password of the NetScaler
This can be done in two ways: in the inventory file, or inline inside the playbook. What is in the playbook will take precedence over the inventory file


## The inventory file
The inventory file is where you can specify the IP / login / password of a NetScaler. For example, if you are running a NetScaler CPX on the same host where you are executing the playbook:

```
$ docker port cpx 80
32773

$ cat inventory.txt
[netscaler]
127.0.0.1 nsip=127.0.0.1:32773 nitro_user=nsroot nitro_pass=nsroot validate_certs=no

$ cat lb_vserver.yml

      local_action:
        nsip: "{{ nsip }}"
        nitro_user: "{{ nitro_user }}"
        nitro_pass: "{{ nitro_pass }}"
```

## In the playbook

```
      local_action:
        nsip: 127.0.0.1:32773
        nitro_user: nsroot
        nitro_pass: nsroot
```
