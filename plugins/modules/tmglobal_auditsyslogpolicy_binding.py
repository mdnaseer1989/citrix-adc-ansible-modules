      - 'Applicable only to advance tmsession policy. Expression or other value specifying
        the next policy to be evaluated if the current policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify
        one of the following values:'
      - '* NEXT - Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number.'
      - '* END - End policy evaluation.'
      - '* An expression that evaluates to a number.'
      - 'If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines
        the next policy to evaluate, as follows:'
      - '* If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy with
        that priority is evaluated next.'
      - '* If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the
        policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next.'
      - '* If the expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically higher
        than the highest numbered priority, policy evaluation ends.'
      - 'An UNDEF event is triggered if:'
      - '* The expression is invalid.'
      - '* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically lower
        than the current policy''s priority.'
      - '* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current
        policy''s priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say,
        100), but does not match any configured priority number (for example, the
        expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority
        number increments by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority
        number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.'
